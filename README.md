Project description:
Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator
We will make a rock-paper-scissors game simulator, which will give the player an opponent with a texture. There will be 3 rounds of matches players need to win and each round will be determined by the best-of-five-round system. After the player wins, he will get the feedback of cheering and victory, and if he loses, he will get the feedback of the failure and need to try again. The entire game will follow a set of comparative logic algorithms to detect wins and losses and score points, until the computer calculates the players' wins and losses. The beginning will be the starting interface, and the restart and return buttons will be assigned during the game.
