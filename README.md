Project description:
Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator
We will make a rock-paper-scissors game simulator, which will give the player an opponent with a texture. There will be 3 rounds of matches players need to win and each round will be determined by the best-of-five-round system. After the player wins, he will get the feedback of cheering and victory, and if he loses, he will get the feedback of the failure and need to try again. The entire game will follow a set of comparative logic algorithms to detect wins and losses and score points, until the computer calculates the players' wins and losses. The beginning will be the starting interface, and the restart and return buttons will be assigned during the game.

Statements：

1.The user will see the start screen with the start, leaderboard, and rules options.

2.When the user hoveres the mouse over the word “RULES" on the start screen, a separate text bubble will be expanded to show the details of the rules.

3.The user will be able to begin rock paper scissors by click the start button from the main slide.

4.The user will have to enter their username for entry in the leaderboard. 

5.The user will play against a computer that will randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors based on random numbers that correlate to each option.

6.The first to win 3 out of 5 matches will be the winner, and each match will run by best-of-three rounds.

7.The user will have three image options to choose from, rock, paper, scissors.

8.There will be a 3 second time limit（with a countdown animation) for the user to make their choice.

9.The user can directly get the current score of the game (including the total score and the authority score) through the scoreboard on both sides of the screen.

10.The winner will be announced on the screen and there will be a prompt to continue to the next round.

11.There will be an option to return to the main menu during the game or when the game ends, for the user to restart the game.
